# OPSkins API for Node.js

This module provides a simple interface to the HTTP-based API for [OPSkins](https://opskins.com).

In order to use most methods, you will need an API key. You can get one from your [account page](https://opskins.com/account).

Like the Steam Web API, the OPSkins API is divided into "interfaces", each of which contains methods which apply to that
interface. This module hides this implementation detail from you, but for simplicity's sake, this documentation is
divided by interface.

# Setting Up

First, you will need to install this module. To do so, simply type on the command line:

    $ npm install @opskins/api
    
If you are developing an application which will depend on this module, you might want to save it in your `package.json`
file as a dependency:

    $ npm install --save @opskins/api

This package's root export is the `OPSkinsAPI` object, which you need to instantiate with your API key.
 
```js
var OPSkinsAPI = require('@opskins/api');
var opskins = new OPSkinsAPI('yourapikey');
```

Instantiation with an API key is optional, but if you don't provide one then you will only be able to use unauthenticated
API methods. Such methods are marked in this documentation.

# Error Handling

There are two types of errors which might be returned by the OPSkins API. **HTTP errors** indicate a serious problem.
For example, the HTTP status code `401` indicates that your API key is invalid, and `404` indicates that the requested
API method does not exist.

The other type of error is an **OPSkins error code**. These error codes [are documented here](https://opskins.com/kb/error-codes).
There is also an enum (implemented as an object) available as an `ErrorCode` property of the root export. [This can be
viewed here.](https://github.com/OPSkins/node-opskins/blob/master/resources/ErrorCode.json) To use the `ErrorCode`
enum, you will want to do something like this:

```js
var OPSkinsAPI = require('@opskins/api');
var ErrorCode = OPSkinsAPI.ErrorCode;

var code = getAnErrorCodeSomehow();
if (code == ErrorCode.ACCESS_DENIED) {
	// access denied
}
```

When you get an `Error` object from a request, it will contain an `httpCode` property, containing the HTTP status code
that the server returned to your request. If this is not `200`, then there will be no other properties defined (save
`message`). If it is `200`, then there will also be a `code` property containing the OPSkins ErrorCode that was returned.
The `Error` object's `message` will usually be a descriptive error message as well.

# Sale Status

An item in the OPSkins system is referred to as a *sale*. Each sale has a *status*, which indicates what state it is in.
Here are the available sale statuses, at time of writing:

- `AwaitingPickup` (1) - This sale has been created but the item has not been traded to an OPSkins storage account yet. There may or may not be an active trade offer for this sale.
- `OnSale` (2) - This item has been traded to the storage account, and it is currently up for sale.
- `AwaitingDelivery` (3) - This item has been purchased, but it has not yet been delivered to its buyer. The seller has not yet been paid for this sale. It is possible that the buyer may refund this sale, which will put the sale back into state `OnSale` (2).
- `Sold` (4) - This item has been sold and delivered. The seller has now been paid for this sale. *
- `AwaitingReturn` (5) - The seller has taken this item off of sale and requested that it be returned to their Steam inventory, but the return is not yet complete. There may or may not be an active trade offer for this sale to return it to its seller.
- `Returned` (6) - The seller has taken this item off of sale and it has been returned to their Steam inventory. *

\* = It is not possible (under normal circumstances) for an item to change from this state to another one.

These sale statuses are available as an enum accessible via the `SaleStatus` property of the `OPSkinsAPI` object.
[View this here.](https://github.com/OPSkins/node-opskins/blob/master/resources/SaleStatus.json) Example:

```js
var OPSkinsAPI = require('@opskins/api');
var SaleStatus = OPSkinsAPI.SaleStatus;

var status = getSaleStatusSomehow();

if (status == SaleStatus.OnSale) {
	// this item is currently on sale
}
```

# Prices

All prices accepted as input and provided as output are in USD cents. This means that a price of $5.42 is represented
as the integer 542.

# HTTPS Agent

As of v1.3.0, by default the module will create a single `keepAlive` HTTPS agent and use it for all requests. This means
reduced latency for requests after the first one within a relatively small time period.

If you need to, you can specify your own Agent by overriding the `getAgent` method. For example:

```js
var OPSkins = require('@opskins/api');
var op = new OPSkins();

op.getAgent = function() {
	return new SomeCustomAgent();
};

op.getSteamID(function(err, steamID) {
	if (err) {
	    console.log(err);
    } else {
		console.log("My SteamID is " + steamID);
    }
});
```

All requests are HTTPS, so your agent should be based on `require('https').Agent`.

the following:

```json
{
    "AK-47 | Black Laminate (Factory New)": {
        "2016-08-10": {"price": 10500},
        "2016-08-14": {"price": 10810},

in no way related to one another. `quantity` is how many of that item are currently on sale, and `price` is the lowest
price at which the item is available. The returned data is updated at most once every 30 minutes. The `prices` object
structure resembles the following:

```json
{

fired before any prices have actually been updated. The server will process your request and you will not be notified
when it completes in any way, unless you request your sales list and check the prices yourself.

This will fail if you attempt to queue a price update for an item which already has a queued price update. Price update
errors will not be reported and will be silently dropped in the background. For example, requests to edit the prices of
items you do not own or which do not exist will be accepted, but will not actually be processed.

        - `featured` - Feature this item. Costs $3.00 if you don't have any featured credits remaining. Uses a credit if you do.
        - `screenshots` - Inspectable CS:GO items only. Takes screenshots of this item and displays them (Instant Field Inspection). Costs 2% of list price, minimum $0.50. If you also feature this item, then the total cost of both addons is capped at $4.50.
- `callback` - A function to be called when the request completes
    - `err` - An `Error` object on failure, or `null` on success
    - `result` - An object containing these properties:

        - `bot_id64` - The 64-bit SteamID of the bot which sent this trade, as a string.
        - `security_token` - The 6-character security token which will be included in the trade offer message.
        - `sales` - An array of objects describing the sales that were created. Each object has these properties:
            - `saleid` - The ID of the sale which was created for this item
            - `appid` - The Steam AppID for this item
            - `contextid` - The Steam context ID in which this item resides in your inventory
            - `assetid` - The Steam asset ID for this item in your inventory
            - `market_name` - The name of this item
            - `price` - The list price of this item
            - `addons` - An array (possibly empty) containing strings for each addon this item has

Lists one or more and sends a trade offer. This will fail if any item has price restrictions which are not met, if any
item cannot be sold on OPSkins, if any item does not exist, or if there is already an active trade offer out to pick up
any of these items. There is a limit on how many items you can list in one request; this can be accessed via
[`getListingLimit`](#getlistinglimitcallback).

If there are already sales created for any of these items but they do not currently have active trade offers, then those
sales will be deleted and new ones will be created. This means that if this request fails to send a trade offer, you may
safely re-request it for the same items.

        - `message` - An error message ("OK" on success)

**v1.4.0 or later is required to use this method**

Bumps one or more items. Bumps cost $0.50, and this will be charged to your account balance (unless you have free bump
credits on your account, in which case those will be consumed first).

### returnItems(saleids, callback)
- `saleids` - An array of sale IDs
- `callback` - A function to be called when the request completes

**v1.3.0 or later is required to use this method**

Requests the return of one or more items you currently have listed for sale on your account. These items must currently
be on sale (state 2) or awaiting return (state 5), and must not already have a trade offer out.

### buyItems(saleids, total, callback)
- `saleids` - An array of OPSkins sale IDs for the items you want to buy
- `total` - The total cost of the items you wish to buy, in USD cents. If this is not correct, the request will fail.
- `callback` - A function to be called when the request completes
    - `err` - An `Error` object on failure, or `null` on success
    - `items` - An array of objects, each of which corresponds to an item you purchased. Each object has these properties:
        - `saleid` - The OPSkins sale ID of the item. This will be one of the IDs you passed in.
        - `new_itemid` - The new OPSkins ID of this item in your OPSkins inventory. This is the ID you need to pass to `withdrawInventoryItems` to withdraw the item to your Steam inventory.
        - `name` - The name of the item
        - `bot_id` - The internal OPSkins ID of the bot which is holding this item

on the same storage account. Sale IDs of all items which were successfully repaired are returned, even those which do
not belong to you. If this fails (`repaired` is `false`), then you will need to contact support in order to have this
item repaired.
